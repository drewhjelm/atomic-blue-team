# Atomic Blue Team
Atomic Blue Team is a collection of Adversary Simulation Tests and Detection Methods based on the Red Canary [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team)

## What is this?

Atomic Red Team gives gives defenders very actionable ways to test defenses against common attacks performed by attackers based on the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, however it does not have references for many of the ways defenders can detect the attacks.

The Atomic Blue Team is broken into 3 spreadsheets with tests built by Atomic Red Team. Evidence to look for on Windows from each test is collected from the [JPCERT IR Tool Analysis Result Sheet](https://jpcertcc.github.io/ToolAnalysisResultSheet/). 

A sample test plan is built based on MITRE Techniques with known tests and the techniques that also have tools with detection guidance.

##todo

* Pull in Linux and MacOS tests and detection methods
* Add additional Red Team tests and detection methods for Windows
* Build summary worksheet similar to the [ThreatHunter Playbook](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/ThreatHunter-Playbook/blob/master/metrics/HuntTeam_HeatMap.xlsx).
